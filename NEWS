=============
RubyOSA 0.2.0
=============

Features:
- Added support for some picture types ;
- Possible to use UTF-8 strings ;
- Translate 'alis' OSA types to Ruby file paths ;
- Added new samples: Finder_show_desktop, BBEdit_unix_script, iTunes_artwork
  and iChat_images ;
- Added support to convert Hash objects to OSA 'record' types ;
- Added support for floating 'sing' and missing 'msng' types.

Bugfixes:
- Handle application errors and convert them as Ruby exceptions ;
- Added 'class' to the list of reserved Ruby keywords to prefix when generating
  method parameters ;
- Suffix method names that are already registered with an integer value
  instead of prefixing with 'osa_' as there might be more than 2 duplicates ;
- Register the ID property if not already defined ;
- Fixed conversion handlers to not use 'self' ;
- Make sure to swap the data of 'type' coerced descriptors ;
- Convert four char codes to the Mac Roman encoding before using them,
  as otherwise they could be considered as 5 bytes strings (ex. BBEdit) ;
- Remove invalid characters when generating constants ;
- Changed the "require 'rubygems'..." expressions to make them compatible with 
  Ruby 1.8.2 ;
- Try to require 'rubygems' in samples, as RubyOSA may have been
  installed as a gem ;
- Fixed generated code for methods taking an enumeration-like parameter.
